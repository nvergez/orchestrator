# Orchestrator — v1 Specification

> The executable spec this repo's [wayfinder map (#1)](https://github.com/nvergez/orchestrator/issues/1) was finding its way to.
> Every section below condenses a decision resolved on the tracker; the linked ticket holds the full rationale, the alternatives that were rejected, and the HITL discussion. When this document and a ticket disagree, the ticket wins.

**What it is.** A Slack-driven **orchestrator-dispatcher**: a single long-lived Node daemon on the operator's VPS that gives a Claude Code agent a Slack presence — **one session per Slack thread** — and lets it interpret requests, **delegate** the work to Orca worktree agents (any allow-listed repo), **supervise** them (worker questions and escalations relayed into the thread), and report status + results back. The orchestrator *never codes itself*; it routes, delegates, supervises, relays.

**Non-goals (v1)** — ruled out of scope on the map:
- Managing Orca automations from Slack.
- Creating / registering new Orca repos or projects from Slack.
- Running arbitrary commands / ops on the VPS (hard-denied by the tool guardrails).

```

Stack decision ([#3](https://github.com/nvergez/orchestrator/issues/3), research asset: [`docs/research/slack-claude-bridge.md`](research/slack-claude-bridge.md)):
- **Slack half**: Bolt (JS) in **Socket Mode** — outbound WebSocket, no public URL/reverse proxy. Internal (non-distributed) app to keep Tier-3 rate limits.
- **Claude half**: **Claude Agent SDK (TypeScript)**, in-process — one `claude` subprocess per thread (fault isolation), session resume via `session_id`, streaming input to inject replies into live sessions, `canUseTool` as the enforcement hook, per-turn cost on `ResultMessage`.
- Rejected: headless CLI shell-out per message (re-implements session tracking), Slack HTTP Events (needs inbound URL), Anthropic-hosted managed agents (`orca` must run on the same machine as the daemon), homegrown loop on the Messages API.

## 2. Slack surface

Provisioned ([#2](https://github.com/nvergez/orchestrator/issues/2)) on the operator's Slack workspace — to provision your own app, see [`docs/setup-slack.md`](setup-slack.md). IDs below are placeholders for the instance's real values:
- App `@orchestrator` (bot user `U0EXAMPLEBOT`), Socket Mode ON; configured channels may be public or private (the bot is a member of each); authorized operators are configured explicitly.
- Bot scopes (6): `chat:write, app_mentions:read, channels:history, groups:history, reactions:write, users:read`. Events: `app_mention`, **`message.groups`** (+ `message.channels`).
  - The channel's **privacy decides the message event**: Slack emits `message.groups` for private channels and `message.channels` for public ones — `groups:history` is load-bearing, not incidental. Subscribing to only `message.channels` on a private channel silently delivers **no message event at all**, so plain thread replies never reach the daemon while `app_mention` keeps working ([#38](https://github.com/nvergez/orchestrator/issues/38)). Both subscriptions arrive as `type: "message"` (private ones carry `channel_type: "group"`), so one listener handles either; a mention fires the `message` copy *and* `app_mention`, deduped by the filter.
- `channels:read` is **not granted and not needed** (channel IDs and user IDs are configured directly; no `conversations.info/members`).
- Secrets in the daemon's env file (chmod 600, outside git; template `.env.example`).

## 3. Session model — thread ↔ Claude Code session

Decision [#5](https://github.com/nvergez/orchestrator/issues/5). Guiding principle: **process liveness ≠ session existence** — the persisted `session_id` is the durable anchor; the subprocess is transient.

- **Open**: a **root** message that **@mentions the bot** in #orchestrator. No mention → no session.
- **Resume**: any reply in a registered thread, no re-mention needed. Ignored: bot's own messages, `subtype` events, other bots, replies in unregistered threads (never a ghost resume).
- **States**: `live` (turn in progress, or warm ≤ 30 min after last turn) ⇄ `dormant` (no process; cold-resume via `query({ resume: session_id })`) → `closed` (final).
- **Concurrency**: FIFO per thread (double-posts queue until next `ResultMessage`); **global cap of 5 live sessions** (env-configurable). At the cap: reap the coldest finished-turn session, else queue the message and post `⏳ queued`. Never a hard reject.
- **Close**: an explicit `close` — the bare word as the whole thread reply, **mention optional** (it was mention-only while mention-less replies never reached the daemon, [#38](https://github.com/nvergez/orchestrator/issues/38)) — posts a closing summary (delegations, cost, turns); or auto-close after **7 days** dormant. Thread-only: a mention-less `close` at the channel root opens nothing, a mentioned one opens a session. A longer sentence containing the word is an ordinary turn. Reply in a closed thread → one fixed line, no resume. No implicit close on task completion.
- **Boot rule**: every session comes back **dormant**; a turn orphaned by a crash waits for the next human message (no auto-resume in v1).

## 4. Repo routing & agent selection

Decision [#10](https://github.com/nvergez/orchestrator/issues/10). Produces the two values of the delegation injection point: `--repo id:<repoId> --agent <codex|claude>`.

- **Routing = anchored LLM inference**: load the living registry (`orca repo list --json`), enrich with the curated **routing hints** file (versioned in this repo; per repo: aliases, one-line description, domain keywords, default agent), then let the LLM pick **from that closed set only**, with confidence.
- **Ambiguity**: 2+ credible candidates → numbered disambiguation question in the thread (that reply doubles as the confirmation). Zero match → **stop + list** the available repos; never a silent fallback repo.
- **Agent precedence**: explicit user choice > per-repo default (hints) > global default **`claude`**. Start all-claude; `codex` accepted but not exercised. No LLM task-type heuristic in v1.
- **Confirmation is conditional**: anything inferred/uncertain → one-line gate *"→ I'm delegating on **X** with **Y**. Go?"*; fully explicit request → delegate directly. One round trip, never two.

## 5. Delegation & supervision (Orca)

Decision [#4](https://github.com/nvergez/orchestrator/issues/4), refined by [#9](https://github.com/nvergez/orchestrator/issues/9). The orchestrator session **is** the coordinator (manual coordination; no autonomous `orchestration run`).

**Delegation sequence** (after routing):

```bash
orca worktree create --repo id:<repoId> --name <repo>-<issue#>-<slug> \
  --agent <codex|claude> --issue <n> --no-parent --json          # no --prompt!
orca terminal list --worktree id:<newWtId> --json
orca terminal wait --terminal <handle> --for tui-idle --timeout-ms 60000 --json
orca orchestration task-create --spec "<brief>" --task-title "<short>" \
  --display-name "<repo>#<n>" --json
orca orchestration dispatch --task <taskId> --to <handle> --inject --json
```

The brief travels via **`dispatch --inject`** (never `--prompt` at create time — the worker must get the coordinator preamble to emit `worker_done`). `--issue <n>` links the GitHub issue: the durable home for status/results beyond the Slack thread.

**State detection — two layers.** Authority = structured messages (`worker_done`, `escalation`, `decision_gate` via `check --wait`) + `task-list`. Watchdog = `worktree ps` `agents[].state` / stale `lastOutputAt` / `tui-idle`, to catch a worker stalled at a prompt without an `ask` → "needs attention" in the thread. A second watchdog signal ([#48](https://github.com/nvergez/orchestrator/issues/48)) catches the inverse — a worker that LOOKS alive (a TUI spinner keeps `lastOutputAt` fresh) but whose bus said nothing (no heartbeat, ask or done) past a max in-flight age (`WATCHDOG_MAX_INFLIGHT_MINUTES`, default 30): same ⚠️ mold, quoting the agent's `state` + `lastAssistantMessage` from `worktree ps`; any bus message from the worker resets the clock. A `check` timeout or `{count:0}` is a checkpoint, not a failure.

**Parallelism**: one coordinator (mailbox) per thread → no cross-thread leakage on the runtime-global bus; multi-repo fan-out in waves; a self-imposed global cap on concurrent workers.

**Cleanup on success** ([#43](https://github.com/nvergez/orchestrator/issues/43)): once a delegation closes as completed — at `worker_done` time or by boot reconciliation — the daemon removes the worktree it created (`orca worktree rm`, deliberately **without** `--force`: a dirty tree makes the runtime refuse, the worktree stays on disk for inspection and the thread gets one 🧹 line saying why). A **failed** delegation always keeps its worktree for debugging. This daemon-side removal is not a session Bash call, so §7's CONFIRM tier does not apply — the gate remains for any deletion the *coordinator session* attempts itself.

## 6. Gate relay — worker questions into the thread and back

Decision [#9](https://github.com/nvergez/orchestrator/issues/9). Architecture: **the daemon listens, the session thinks.**

- After a dispatch the session **ends its turn** and may doze; the **daemon** holds one child `orca orchestration check --wait --terminal <mailbox> --types worker_done,escalation,decision_gate` per thread with in-flight work (rolling windows). The mailbox is a lightweight terminal `slack-<thread_ts>`, lazily created at first dispatch, remembered in SQLite, passed as `--from` at dispatch.
- An event **wakes the session exactly like a human message**. Wakes are uniform: human message, orchestration event, watchdog alert — three inputs, one pipe. At boot the daemon re-arms all watchers from SQLite.
- **Relay up** (new message, never an edit): worktree name + issue link, the worker's question **verbatim** (blockquote, never paraphrased), numbered options if any, "reply in this thread". `escalation` = same, marked 🚨. Watchdog = same mold + last terminal output. One exception ([#46](https://github.com/nvergez/orchestrator/issues/46)): a worker re-asking the same question after an `ask` timeout **edits** the existing relay in place — one notification per logical question; the stale gate flips to `superseded`, forwarding to the re-ask.
- **Route back down** — the LLM routes the human reply, anchored on the SQLite `pending_gates` registry:
  - `decision_gate` / `escalation` → `orca orchestration reply --id <msg_id> --body "<answer>"` (nominal path);
  - worker stalled at a TUI prompt (no `ask`) → `orca terminal send --terminal <handle> --text "…" --enter`;
  - **never `gate-resolve`** in this relay (DAG gates are reserved for coordinator DAG decisions).
  - Fidelity: "2" → forward option 2's text verbatim; free text as-is. The LLM never rephrases a human decision.
- **Disambiguation**: cross-thread impossible by construction (per-thread mailbox + registry filtered by `thread_ts`). Intra-thread with 2+ pending gates → LLM match on clues, **clarify-on-doubt** at the slightest doubt. An `answered` gate never re-routes (best-effort correction via `terminal send`).

## 7. Autonomy & security boundaries

Decision [#8](https://github.com/nvergez/orchestrator/issues/8). Enforcement = the SDK's **`canUseTool`** hook on the Bash tool, three tiers:

| Tier | What | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **AUTO** | reads/observation (`orca repo list`, `worktree ps`, `terminal list/wait`, `check`, `task-list`, `gh …view/list`); the full delegation sequence; relays carrying a human reply | silent |
| **CONFIRM** | `git push` / `git merge`, `gh pr merge`, deploys, deletions (`worktree delete`, `rm`, branches), writes outside the delegated worktree | one-line gate in the thread; the call suspends until the reply |
| **FORBIDDEN** | anything outside the `orca` / `gh` / `git` allow-list; Orca automations; repo creation/registration | hard deny, never asked |

- **Repo allow-list = the routing hints file**: no entry ⇒ not delegable, even if registered in Orca (treated as zero-match). Adding a repo = one edit to the hints file. Example set: `webapp`, `tooling`, `sandbox`, `orchestrator`.
- **Cost: measure-only in v1.** SQLite ledger (per-session `turn_count`, `cost_usd_total` from `ResultMessage`); threshold warnings in the thread at **$5 then $10** (env-configurable); nothing ever blocks; no time cap. Known limitation: delegated workers' own token usage is not measured.
- **User allow-list (env)**: `SLACK_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` is a comma-separated shared-operator allow-list, filtered at the source. Any allowed operator may open, reply to, answer a gate in, or close any managed thread; `root_user` records attribution, not ownership. Third-party @mention → one-line polite refusal, no session. Third-party reply inside an active thread → **silently ignored, never injected** (anti-injection: resumption needs no re-mention).
- **Crash recovery: reconcile + notify, resume on demand.** Workers are independent processes — never killed at boot. At boot: re-read `delegations` with `status=dispatched`, reconcile against `task-list` + `worktree ps`, post one ⚠️ status line per affected thread **without waking sessions**; the next human message resumes supervision. Nothing is lost: results stay reachable via the linked GitHub issue and `task-list`.

## 8. Slack UX

Decision [#7](https://github.com/nvergez/orchestrator/issues/7); visual reference: [`docs/prototypes/slack-ux/`](prototypes/slack-ux/) (README = grammar, conversations.md = 7 validated scenarios, block-kit.md = rejected variant, kept for the record).

Guiding principle: **"edit the status, post the event."** Anything requiring the human (gate, escalation, done, stalled, cost threshold) = a **new message** (it notifies); anything ambient (progress, liveness) = in-place edit or reaction.

- **Pure mrkdwn** — Block Kit rejected for v1 (text is the mechanism per #6-relay; buttons would add a second reply path).
- **Root reactions** = coarse state readable from the channel: 👀 in progress · ❓ blocked on the human · 🚨 attention · ✅ delivered · ❌ failed (stale one removed).
- **One card per delegation**, posted at dispatch and edited at **milestones** only (worktree created, brief handed over, heartbeats, done) + a liveness line at most every 2 min — never a token stream. The conversational **voice** streams via post-then-edit (~1 edit/s, Tier-3 throttle).
- **Done**: the card flips to ✅ and becomes the durable home for links (PR, issue, worktree path, duration) **and** a short summary goes out as a new message.
- **Reference verbatims** (fixed by the mock): autonomy gate `🚦 <command> on <worktree> — go?`; worker gate = verbatim question + numbered options + "Reply in this thread"; queue `⏳ Queued (5 active sessions)…`; close 🔚 summary; cost `💸 This thread has cost $5.03…`; third party "v1: only <@U0EXAMPLE456> can drive me."; reboot `⚠️ Restarted — <repo>#<n> was in flight: <state>. Reply to resume supervision.`
- **No welcome message** — no per-thread pin, no channel pin/canvas.

## 9. Data model (SQLite)

One database: `~/.local/state/orchestrator/orchestrator.db` (override: `ORCHESTRATOR_DB_PATH`). Survives any git operation on the checkout; never in the repo.

- **`sessions`** — key `thread_ts` (+ `channel_id`): `session_id`, `root_user`, `status ∈ {open, closed}`, `created_at`, `last_activity_at`, `turn_count`, `cost_usd_total`. (#5)
- **`delegations`** — `task_id`, `dispatch_id`, `worktree_id`, `issue#`, `repo`, `thread_ts`, `channel_id`, `status`; written at dispatch, closed on `worker_done`; drives boot reconciliation. (#8/#93)
- **`pending_gates`** — `msg_id`, `thread_ts`, `channel_id`, `task_id`, `dispatch_id`, `worker_handle`, worktree name, question, options, relay Slack ts, `status ∈ {pending, answered, superseded, closed}` + `superseded_by`; written by the daemon at relay time; anchors answer routing — which only ever considers `pending` rows in the same `(channel_id, thread_ts)`: a re-ask supersedes its stale gate, and a closing delegation closes its unanswered ones. (#9, #46, #93)
- Mailbox terminal handles per thread are also remembered here (#9).
- Pure runtime state (process handles, throttle buffers, warm flags) is **not** persisted — lost harmlessly on restart.

## 10. Deployment & operations

Decision [#6](https://github.com/nvergez/orchestrator/issues/6). Operator runbook for the packaged install (service management, updates, uninstall): [`docs/operations.md`](operations.md).

- **The daemon is this repo**: `package.json` at the root, code in `src/`; the `main` checkout at `<checkout>` **is** the deployed instance. Deploy = `git pull` + `npm ci` + `systemctl --user restart orchestrator`.
- **systemd user unit** `~/.config/systemd/user/orchestrator.service`: `ExecStart` = absolute node path (e.g. `~/.nvm/versions/node/<version>/bin/node` — user units don't source shell profiles); `Environment=PATH=…` including the `orca` CLI's bin dir + the node bin dir (SDK spawns the bundled `claude`); `WorkingDirectory=` the checkout; `Restart=always`, `RestartSec=5`; `WantedBy=default.target` + enable → reboot survival via linger. Cold restart is safe by design (#5 boot rule). Ops note: in Orca shells, `export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u)` before `systemctl --user`/`journalctl --user`.
- **Auth**: `claude setup-token` → **`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`** in the env file (subscription-billed; independent of the interactive login used by delegated workers). Never `--bare` (strips the OAuth token). `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` = plan B only.
- **Secrets**: `EnvironmentFile=` pointing at the daemon's env file; code reads `process.env` only (no dotenv). Dev run: `node --env-file=.env`.
- **Orca dependency**: none at boot (user units can't order against system units anyway). Non-blocking startup healthcheck (`orca repo list --json`, logged); **every `orca` call wrapped** — on failure, a clear "Orca runtime unavailable" message in the thread, never a crash.
- **Logs**: structured JSON (pino) on stdout → persistent journald (rotation already configured). `LOG_LEVEL` env (default `info`). Read: `journalctl --user -u orchestrator -f`.

## 11. Configuration (`.env`)

| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | `xoxb-…` bot token (#2) |
| `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` | `xapp-…` app-level token, `connections:write` (#2) |
| `SLACK_CHANNEL_IDS` | Comma-separated `C…` channel IDs served by this bot (#93) |
| `SLACK_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` | Comma-separated `U…` shared-operator allow-list (#93) |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | daemon auth, from `claude setup-token` (#6) |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | pino level, default `info` (#6) |
| `ORCHESTRATOR_DB_PATH` | optional SQLite override (#6) |
| *(cap & threshold vars)* | live-session cap (default 5, #5); cost warning thresholds (default 5, 10 USD, #8); warmth TTL (default 30 min, #5) |

## 12. Known v1 limitations (accepted)

- A turn in flight at crash time is orphaned — no auto-resume; the session waits for the next human message (#5).
- Delegated workers' token usage isn't metered — the ledger sees only the orchestrator session (#8).
- No cost/time hard caps — warnings only, to be calibrated from ledger data in v2 (#8).
- `closed` is final — no thread reopening (#5).
- `channels:read` not granted — configured IDs are sufficient; grant + reinstall only if channel metadata is ever needed (#2/#6/#93).
